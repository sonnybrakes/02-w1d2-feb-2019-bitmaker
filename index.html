      <p>The HTML5 <code>noscript</code> element represents nothing if scripting is enabled, and represents its children if scripting is disabled. It is used to present different markup to user agents that support scripting and those that don't support scripting, by affecting how the document is parsed.</p>

      <p>The HTML5 <code>iframe</code> element represents a nested browsing context. For <code>iframe</code> elements in HTML documents, the attribute, if present, must have a value using the HTML syntax that consists of the following syntactic components, in the given order:
        <ul>
          <li>Any number of comments and space characters.</li>
          <li>Optionally, a DOCTYPE.</li>
          <li>Any number of comments and space characters.</li>
          <li>The root element, in the form of an html element.</li>
          <li>Any number of comments and space characters.</li>
        </ul>
      </p>
    <hr>
    <header class="#">
      <p>The HTML5 <code>hr</code> element (horizontal rule) represents a paragraph-level thematic break. The "paragraph-level" bit means between blocks of text, so it can't be used to separate sections of a site. Instead, <code>hr</code> now separates different topics within a section of prose, or between scenes in a novel.</p>


      <h1> <!-- hidden comment -->
        <a href="#">
          <span>
            <img src="https://alistapart.com/components/assets/img/ala-logo-big.png" alt="A List Apart">
          </span>
        </a>
        <span>A List Apart</span>
      </h1>

      <p>The HTML5 <code>header</code> element represents the "header" of a document or section of a document. The <code>header</code> element is typically used to group a set of <code>h1</code>–<code>h6</code> elements to mark up a page's title with its subtitle or tagline. <code>header</code> elements may, however, contain more than just the section's headings and subheadings — e.g., version history information or publication date. February 15, 2019</p>

      <p>An HTML5 <code>img</code> element represents an image. The image given by the <code class="attribute">src</code> attribute is the embedded content, and the value of the <code class="attribute">alt</code> attribute is the <code>img</code> element's fallback content. The <code class="attribute">src</code> attribute must be present, and must contain a valid non-empty URL potentially surrounded by spaces referencing a non-interactive, optionally animated, image resource that is neither paged nor scripted. The <code>img</code> element must not be used as a layout tool. In particular, <code>img</code> elements should not be used to display transparent images, as they rarely convey meaning and rarely add anything useful to the document.</p>

      <p>The HTML5 <code>h1</code> (h1 to h6) elements represent headings and subheadings. These elements rank in importance according to the number in their name. The <code>h1</code> element is said to have the highest rank, the <code>h6</code> element has the lowest rank, and two elements with the same name have equal rank.</p>

      <p>If the HTML5 <code>a</code> element has an <code class="attribute">href</code> attribute, then it represents a hyperlink (a hypertext anchor). If the <code>a</code> element has no <code class="attribute">href</code> attribute, then the element represents a placeholder for where a link might otherwise have been placed, if it had been relevant. The <code class="attribute">target</code>, <code class="attribute">rel</code>, <code class="attribute">media</code>, <code class="attribute">hreflang</code>, and <code class="attribute">type</code> attributes must be omitted if the <code class="attribute">href</code> attribute is not present.</p>

      <p>The HTML5 <code>span</code> element doesn't mean anything on its own, but can be useful when used together with the global attributes, e.g. class, lang, or dir. It represents its children.</p>

      <p>The HTML5 <code>nav</code> element represents navigation for a document. The <code>nav</code> element is a section containing links to other documents or to parts within the current document. Not all groups of links on a page need to be in a <code>nav</code> element — only groups of primary navigation links. In particular, it is common for footers to have a list of links to various key parts of a site, but the <code>footer</code> element is more appropriate in such cases.</p>

      <p>The HTML5 <code>ul</code>element represents a list of items, where the order of the items is not important — that is, where changing the order would not materially change the meaning of the list.</p>

      <p>The HTML5 <code>li</code>element represents a list item. If its parent element is an <code>ol</code>, <code>ul</code>, or <code>menu</code> element, then the element is an item of the parent element's list, as defined for those elements. Otherwise, the list item has no defined list-related relationship to any other <code>li</code> element.</p>

      <p>The HTML5 <code>form</code> element represents a collection of form-associated elements, some of which can represent editable values that can be submitted to a server for processing.</p>

      <p>The HTML5 <code>input</code> element represents a typed data field, usually with a form control to allow the user to edit the data.</p>

      <p>The HTML5 <code>label</code> element represents a caption in a user interface. The caption can be associated with a specific form control, known as the label element's labeled control, either using for attribute, or by putting the form control inside the label element itself.</p>
